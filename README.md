# A Robust Feature Extraction Pipeline for Detecting Elephant Rumbles üêò

## About üí¨

A sound processing pipeline for accurately detecting elephant rumbles recorded by the ELOC node. For robust feature extraction and noise denoising of the elephant rumbles, a novel approach known as **Wavelet Transform** is used. The proposed research methodology incorporates 4 main modules: 
- **Pre-processing module**
- **Feature extraction module**
- **Feature selection module**
- **Classifier**

The two datasets used by this study is as follows:
- **Dataset-1:** Replayed elephant rumbles and negative dataset captured using Eloc node.
- **Dataset-2:** A collection of originally-recorded elephant rumbles and other non-elephant sounds captured in the same field has used as the positive and negative datasets.

The following figure represents the high-level diagram of the proposed methodology.

- Initially, an infrasonic sound signal is captured by the two microphones in the ELOC. 
- After capturing the audio signal, it will pass it to the pre-processing module. This module consists of 3 sub-modules; **Butterworth band-pass filter** mitigates the influence of the low-frequency noise and high-frequency noise that exists beyond the typical range of elephant rumbles. **Wavelet-based denoising** further denoise the input signal and **beamforming based stereo to mono conversion**, convert the stereo infrasound recoding into the signal channel while improves the strength of the dominant sound source and reducing the strength of noise coming from the other directions.
- Secondly, the processed signal passes into the feature extraction module. And it consists of 3 sub-modules, and it extracts the **672 features** from the given signal as well as **wavelet based reconstructed variations** of that signal to analyse the signal more precisely. 
- After that, extracted feature vector passes into the feature reduction module which consists of two pre-trained sub-modules. First, sub-module brings the feature vectors into **normalized scale** while minimizing the effects of outliers. Normalized feature vector then passes into second sub-module, and it returns the pre-defined most robust and relevant subset of features from the given feature vector.
- Finally, reduced feature vector passes into the pre-trained classifier. The classifier will determine whether given signal segment consists of infrasonic elephant rumble or not.
