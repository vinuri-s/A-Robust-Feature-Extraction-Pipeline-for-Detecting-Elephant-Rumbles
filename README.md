# A-Robust-Feature-Extraction-Pipeline-for-Detecting-Elephant-Rumbles

A sound processing pipeline for accurately detecting elephant rumbles recorded by the ELOC node. For robust feature extraction and noise denoising of the elephant rumbles, a novel approach known as Wavelet Transform is used.
The proposed research methodology incorporates 4 main modules: Pre-processing module, Feature extraction module, Feature selection module, and Classifier. The following figure represents the high-level diagram of the proposed methodology.
