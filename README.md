# A-Robust-Feature-Extraction-Pipeline-for-Detecting-Elephant-Rumbles

## About

A sound processing pipeline for accurately detecting elephant rumbles recorded by the ELOC node. For robust feature extraction and noise denoising of the elephant rumbles, a novel approach known as **Wavelet Transform** is used. The proposed research methodology incorporates 4 main modules: 
- **Pre-processing module**
- **Feature extraction module**
- **Feature selection module**
- **Classifier**

The following figure represents the high-level diagram of the proposed methodology.

The two datasets used by this study is as follows:
- **Dataset-1:** Replayed elephant rumbles and negative dataset captured using Eloc node.
- **Dataset-2:** A collection of originally-recorded elephant rumbles and other non-elephant sounds captured in the same field has used as the positive and negative datasets.
